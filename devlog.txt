Day 1
Max created README.txt
Matt created devlog.txt

##########################
Day 2
Matt was absent but we started running test algorithims

##########################
Day3
We created another alogrithim, with different projections. Still not refined

##########################
Day 4 

Matt created 4 methods for Graph.java. Took a while, should be complete.
Matt adjusted Stock.java functionality. Added get and set methods.

Day 6

Matt added amtOwned to stock
Matt revised SubStock progress algorithms. Added momVol.
Max split the driver.java into Market and Main in order to facilitate non static operations
